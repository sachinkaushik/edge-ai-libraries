# Deep Learning Streamer (DL Streamer) Pipeline Framework

## Overview
<div align="center"><img src="intro.gif" width=900/></div>

[Deep Learning Streamer](./docs/source/index.md) (**DL Streamer**) Pipeline Framework is an open-source streaming media analytics framework, based on [GStreamer*](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org) multimedia framework, for creating complex media analytics pipelines for the Cloud or at the Edge.

**Media analytics** is the analysis of audio & video streams to detect, classify, track, identify and count objects, events and people. The analyzed results can be used to take actions, coordinate events, identify patterns and gain insights across multiple domains: retail store and events facilities analytics, warehouse and parking management, industrial inspection, safety and regulatory compliance, security monitoring, and many other.

## Backend libraries
DL Streamer Pipeline Framework is optimized for performance and functional interoperability between GStreamer* plugins built on various backend libraries
* Inference plugins use [OpenVINO™ inference engine](https://docs.openvino.ai) optimized for Intel CPU, GPU and VPU platforms
* Video decode and encode plugins utilize [GPU-acceleration based on VA-API](https://github.com/GStreamer/gstreamer-vaapi)
* Image processing plugins based on [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and [DPC++](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-programming-model/data-parallel-c-dpc.html)
* Hundreds other [GStreamer* plugins](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/plugins_doc.html) built on various open-source libraries for media input and output, muxing and demuxing, decode and encode

## Compilation
You can build DL Streamer using the provided Makefile. Reference `make help` for a list of all available targets.
Currently building is supported for Ubuntu 24.04 and Ubuntu 22.04 systems.

#### Compile Deep Learning Streamer and it's dependencies with
```bash
make build
```

Assuming that you cloned this repository to `$HOME/edge-ai-libraries`, you can run the compiled DL Streamer by configuring your environment with these values:
```bash
export LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=iHD
